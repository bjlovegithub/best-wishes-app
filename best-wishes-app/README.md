# Development
## `create-react-native-app` vs `react-native init`
`create-react-native-app` is quite easy to setup an environment to play with
React Native Apps. `react-native init` is going to create the whole file set,
including xcode project files for iOS.
To have xcode project files for apps created by `create-react-native-app`,
`react-native eject` to get those files.
